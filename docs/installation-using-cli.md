## Installation using Velero CLI

First initialize velero plugin:

```bash
# Initialize velero from scratch:
velero install \
       --provider "community.openstack.org/openstack" \
       --plugins lirt/velero-plugin-for-openstack:v0.6.0 \
       --bucket <SWIFT_CONTAINER_NAME> \
       --no-secret

# Or add a plugin to existing velero:
velero plugin add lirt/velero-plugin-for-openstack:v0.6.0
```

Then change configuration of `backupstoragelocations.velero.io`:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: BackupStorageLocation
metadata:
  name: <NAME>
  namespace: <NAMESPACE>
spec:
  objectStorage:
    bucket: <CONTAINER_NAME>
  provider: community.openstack.org/openstack
  # config:
  #   cloud: cloud1
  #   region: fra
  #   # If you want to enable restic you need to set resticRepoPrefix to this value:
  #   #   resticRepoPrefix: swift:<CONTAINER_NAME>:/<PATH>
  #   resticRepoPrefix: swift:my-awesome-container:/restic # Example
```

For backups of Cinder volumes create configuration of `volumesnapshotlocations.velero.io`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotLocation
metadata:
  name: <NAME>
  namespace: <NAMESPACE>
spec:
  provider: community.openstack.org/openstack-cinder
  config:
    # optional Cloud:
    #   in case clouds.yaml is used as authentication method, cloud allows
    #   user to select which cloud from the clouds.yaml to use for volume backups
    cloud: ""
    # optional Region:
    #   in case multiple regions exist in a single cloud, select which region
    #   will be used for cinder volume backups.
    region: ""
    # optional snapshot method:
    # * "snapshot" is a default cinder snapshot method
    # * "clone" is for a full volume clone instead of a snapshot allowing the
    # source volume to be deleted
    # * "backup" is for a full volume backup uploaded to a Cinder backup
    # allowing the source volume to be deleted (EXPERIMENTAL)
    # * "image" is for a full volume backup uploaded to a Glance image
    # allowing the source volume to be deleted (EXPERIMENTAL)
    # requires the "enable_force_upload" Cinder option to be enabled on the server
    method: snapshot
    # optional resource readiness timeouts in Golang time format: https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration
    # (default: 5m)
    volumeTimeout: 5m
    snapshotTimeout: 5m
    cloneTimeout: 5m
    backupTimeout: 5m
    imageTimeout: 5m
    # ensures that the Cinder volume/snapshot is removed
    # if an original snapshot volume was marked to be deleted, the volume may
    # end up in "error_deleting" status.
    # if the volume/snapshot is in "error_deleting" status, the plugin will try to reset
    # its status (usually extra admin permissions are required) and delete it again
    # within the defined "snapshotTimeout" or "cloneTimeout"
    ensureDeleted: "true"
    # a delay to wait between delete/reset actions when "ensureDeleted" is enabled
    ensureDeletedDelay: 10s
    # deletes all dependent volume resources (i.e. snapshots) before deleting
    # the clone volume (works only, when a snapshot method is set to clone)
    cascadeDelete: "true"
    # backups will be created incrementally (works only when snapshot method is set to backup)
    incrementalBackup: "true"
```

For backups of Manila shares create another configuration of `volumesnapshotlocations.velero.io`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotLocation
metadata:
  name: <NAME>
  namespace: <NAMESPACE>
spec:
  provider: community.openstack.org/openstack-manila
  config:
    # optional Cloud:
    #   in case clouds.yaml is used as authentication method, cloud allows user
    #   to select which cloud from the clouds.yaml to use for manila share backups
    cloud: ""
    # optional Region:
    #   in case multiple regions exist in a single cloud, select which region
    #   will be used for manila share backups.
    region: ""
    # optional snapshot method:
    # * "snapshot" is a default manila snapshot method
    # * "clone" is for a full share clone instead of a snapshot allowing the
    # source share to be deleted
    method: snapshot
    # optional Manila CSI driver name (default: nfs.manila.csi.openstack.org)
    driver: ceph.manila.csi.openstack.org
    # optional resource readiness timeouts in Golang time format: https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration
    # (default: 5m)
    shareTimeout: 5m
    snapshotTimeout: 5m
    cloneTimeout: 5m
    replicaTimeout: 5m
    # ensures that the Manila share/snapshot/replica is removed
    # this is a workaround to the https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2025641 and
    # https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1960239 bugs
    # if the share/snapshot/replica is in "error_deleting" status, the plugin will try
    # to reset its status (usually extra admin permissions are required) and delete it
    # again within the defined "cloneTimeout", "snapshotTimeout" or "replicaTimeout"
    ensureDeleted: "true"
    # a delay to wait between delete/reset actions when "ensureDeleted" is enabled
    ensureDeletedDelay: 10s
    # deletes all dependent share resources (i.e. snapshots, replicas) before deleting
    # the clone share (works only, when a snapshot method is set to clone)
    cascadeDelete: "true"
    # enforces availability zone checks when the availability zone of a
    # snapshot/share differs from the Velero metadata
    enforceAZ: "true"
```
